# Autonomous-Vehicle-Speed-Control-System-using-V2V-Communication
A GPS-integrated autonomous speed control system using the ATmega8 microcontroller. It automatically enforces speed limits by comparing real-time coordinates with pre-defined zone maps. Features include NMEA data parsing, PWM-based motor governance via an ESC, and a Hall Effect sensor feedback loop for precise speed regulation.
